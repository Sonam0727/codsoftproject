1. Titanic Survival Prediction
Overview:
Objective: Predict whether a passenger survived based on features like age, gender, ticket class, and fare.
Dataset: Contains information about passengers, including their survival status.
Steps:
Data Exploration:

Understand the data structure and identify missing values.
Analyze survival rates across features (e.g., gender, class).
Data Preprocessing:

Handle missing values (e.g., fill missing Age with the median).
Convert categorical features like Sex and Embarked into numeric format.
Feature Engineering:

Drop irrelevant columns like Name and Ticket.
Scale or normalize numerical features if necessary.
Modeling:

Use classification models such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, or Gradient Boosting.
Split data into training and testing sets.
Evaluation:

Use metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to assess model performance.
2. Movie Rating Prediction
Overview:
Objective: Predict a movie's rating based on features like genre, director, and cast.
Dataset: Contains historical movie data with ratings.
Steps:
Data Exploration:

Understand the relationships between features (e.g., genre, director) and ratings.
Identify missing values and outliers.
Data Preprocessing:

Encode categorical features like genre and director using one-hot encoding or embeddings.
Normalize numerical features (e.g., budget, runtime).
Feature Engineering:

Extract additional features (e.g., count of actors, genre popularity).
Remove irrelevant or redundant features.
Modeling:

Use regression models such as Linear Regression, Random Forest Regressor, or Gradient Boosting.
Split data into training and testing sets.
Evaluation:

Use metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R².
3. Iris Flower Classification
Overview:
Objective: Classify Iris flowers into three species based on sepal and petal measurements.
Dataset: A small, clean dataset with measurements of flowers.
Steps:
Data Exploration:

Visualize the data using scatter plots and pair plots.
Check for patterns between features and species.
Data Preprocessing:

Normalize or scale features to ensure equal importance.
Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
Modeling:

Train classification models like Logistic Regression, k-Nearest Neighbors, or Support Vector Machines.
Use cross-validation to optimize performance.
Evaluation:

Use metrics like accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.
4. Sales Prediction
Overview:
Objective: Predict sales volume based on factors like advertising expenditure and target audience.
Dataset: Includes features like advertising spend, demographics, and past sales.
Steps:
Data Exploration:

Analyze correlations between advertising spend and sales.
Check for seasonal trends or patterns in sales data.
Data Preprocessing:

Handle missing values and outliers.
Normalize features like advertising budget.
Feature Engineering:

Create new features, such as interaction terms or time-based trends.
Use one-hot encoding for categorical variables.
Modeling:

Use regression models like Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, or Random Forest Regressor.
Consider time-series analysis for forecasting.
Evaluation:

Evaluate using MAE, MSE, or R².
5. Credit Card Fraud Detection
Overview:
Objective: Identify fraudulent transactions in credit card data.
Dataset: A highly imbalanced dataset where fraudulent transactions are rare.
Steps:
Data Exploration:

Understand the class imbalance and patterns in transaction features.
Visualize fraudulent vs. genuine transactions.
Data Preprocessing:

Normalize transaction amounts and other numerical features.
Address class imbalance using techniques like:
Oversampling: Use methods like SMOTE to create synthetic samples of the minority class.
Undersampling: Remove samples from the majority class.
Modeling:

Use classification algorithms like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, or XGBoost.
Use ensemble techniques like Bagging or Boosting for better performance.
Evaluation:

Use metrics like:
Precision: Ratio of correctly predicted frauds to all predicted frauds.
Recall: Ratio of correctly predicted frauds to all actual frauds.
F1-score: Harmonic mean of precision and recall.
Confusion Matrix: Evaluate True Positives, False Positives, etc.
Improving Results:

Experiment with different models and hyperparameters.
Use cost-sensitive learning if the cost of false negatives is very high.
